#    Returns X11BASE.
#
#  pkg_site_builder(true|false)
#    Returns an URI of the packages directory on the package builder site;
#    if an argument is true, a 'latest' directory is used for path, 
#    'full' is used otherwise.
#    Equivalent to:
#     on i386:
#      sprintf('http://pointyhat.FreeBSD.org/errorlogs/%s-%s-packages-%s/',
#              OS_PLATFORM, OS_MAJOR, latest ? 'latest' : 'full')
#
#  pkg_site_mirror(root)
#    Returns an URI of the packages directory on the preferred mirror site;
#    where <root> is any quoted string.
#    Equivalent to:
#      sprintf('%s/pub/FreeBSD/ports/%s/packages-%s/',
#              root  || ENV['PACKAGEROOT'] || 'ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org',

#      pkg_site_mirror('ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org')
#
#  deorigin(origin)
#    Returns an installed package name which was installed from the
#    given origin port.
#    e.g.
#      deorigin('sysutils/portupgrade') => 'portupgrade-YYYYMMDD'
#
#  enabled_rc_scripts(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns an array of "enabled" rc scripts ($PREFIX/etc/rc.d/*.sh)
#    for the given package.  "Enabled" here means that files such as
#    *.sh.sample are ignored, however, if a package installs
#    foo.sh.sample and there is foo.sh, it is considered as an enabled
#    rc file for the package and thus returned.
#
#  disabled_rc_scripts(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns an array of disabled rc scripts ($PREFIX/etc/rc.d/*.sh.*)
#    that the given package installed.  If a package installs
#    foo.sh.sample and there is foo.sh, it is considered as enabled
#    and thus ignored.
#
#  cmd_start_rc(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns a command line string that starts the services of the
#    given package, if any. (Yields "start" for each enabled rc
#    script)
#
#  cmd_stop_rc(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns a command line string that stops the services of the
#    given package, if any. (Yields "stop" for each enabled rc script)
#
#  cmd_restart_rc(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns a command line string that restarts the services of the
#    given package, if any. (Yields "stop", sleeps for 3 seconds, then
#    yields "start" for each enabled rc script)
#
#  cmd_enable_rc(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns a command line string that enables the disabled rc
#    scripts of given package, if any.
#
#  cmd_disable_rc(origin_or_pkgname)
#    Returns a command line string that disables the enabled rc
#    scripts of given package, if any.
#
#  include_env(file)
#    Include and evaluate the file. The file is looked inside PREFIX.
#
#  include_hash(glob)
#    Read file(s) and convert them to hash. Files should contain lines
#    in a format: 'key' => 'value'
#    (Glob path is inside PREFIX).
#    E.g. ALT_PKGDEP = include_hash('etc/pkgtools/alt_pkgdep/*')

  # installed, the dependency is replaced with one installed
  # package that matches the "pkgname glob" pattern B.  If glob B
  # matches more than one installed package, replacement is not done

  # be used as B values, instead of pkgname glob patterns.  <:delete>
  # means to delete the dependency and <:skip> to skip it.
